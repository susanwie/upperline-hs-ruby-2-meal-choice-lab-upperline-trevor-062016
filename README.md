Open this lab in Nitrous. Code your solution in the `meal_choice.rb` file. 

Your job is to define three methods, `breakfast`, `lunch` and `dinner` that take in a food as a string and returns a string stating the appropriate time to eat that food. For example, calling `breakfast("scrambled eggs")` should return something like `"Morning is the best time for scrambled eggs!"`

**Include a default meal_choice** for each method so that if no food is specified, it defaults to your favorite food. For example, calling `breakfast` with no argument should return `"Morning is the best time for Frosted Flakes!"` Take a look at the example code to get started. 

Call all of your methods (with and without arguments) at the bottom of the file. Then run your program.
